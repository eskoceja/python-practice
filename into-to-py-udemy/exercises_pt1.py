# Variables, operators, and strings

# 1. script should add 15 + 30 and divide the sum by 2
num1 = 15
num2 = 30
answer = (num1 + num2) / 2
print(answer)

# 2. initialize 2 variables and use arithmetic operators to add, subtract, multiply, divide, and find the remainder
a = 4
b = 5
print(a + b)
print(a - b)
print(a * b)
print(a / b)
print(a % b)

# 3. create variable called name and store it in a string
name = "Shrek"
print(name)

# 4. create 3 variables in on line and assign each one a diff food item
shrek, fiona, donkey = "onions", "chicken", "waffles"
print(shrek, fiona, donkey)

# 5. print "hello" 10 times using arithmetic operators
print("Hello\n" * 10)

# 6. set your name and age variables in one line with multiple assignment
name, age = "Emily", 28
print(name, age)

# 7. create 2 strings and then create a 3rd variable combining both of the original strings
var1 = "hello"
var2 = "word"
var3 = var1 + " " + var2
print(var3)

# 8. create a string and print the 4th letter of the word
word = "Donkey"
print(word[3])

# 9. create a string and print letters from index 0 to 5
print(word[0:5])

# 10. create a variable and print all the letters from the first index until the end
print(word[1:])
